# Communication Commands
The following sections indicate the types of commands that can be sent to the Boat Control Panel, with examples and purpose.

## System Commands
These are commands used to configure the system settings and can only be sent from a computer, they are not used for internal communication.

| Command | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `F0` — Heart beat | `F0` | Send at rated intervals, if no ACK received indicates there is no connection available between control panel and fuse box. No params. |
| `F1` — System Initialized | `F1` | Sent by the system when initialization is complete to signal readiness. No params. Used to notify connected devices or software that the control panel is ready for operation. |
| `F2` — Free Memory | `F2` | When received will return the amount of free memory. |
| `F3` — Cpu Usage | `F3` | When received will return the current CPU usage. No params. |
| `F4` — Bluetooth Enabled | `F4` | When received will return the current enabled state of bluetooth 0 off 1 on. No params. |

## Configuration Commands
These are commands used to configure the system settings and can only be sent from a computer, they are not used for internal communication.

| Command | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|

| `C9` — Sound delay Start | `C9:v=0xFF` | Sets the delay before the sound is started in milliseconds, allows other processing to continue so as sounds are not cut off. Invalid or missing value → error. |
| `C10` — Bluetooth Enabled (SFB) | `C10:v=1` | Sets the enabled state of bluetooth, 0 disabled, 1 enabled, if disabling then a restart is required. Invalid or missing value → error. |
| `C11` — Wifi Enabled (SFB) | `C11:v=1` | Sets the enabled state of wifi, 0 disabled, 1 enabled, if disabling then a restart is required. Invalid or missing value → error. |
| `C12` — Wifi Access Mode (SFB) | `C12:v=1` | Sets access mode, 0 is AP and 1 is client |
| `C13` — Wifi SSID (SFB) | `C13:v=RouterName` | Set's the wifi SSID, only available if access mode is client |
| `C14` — Wifi Password (SFB) | `C14:v=Password123` | Set's the wifi password, only available if access mode is client |
| `C15` — Wifi Port (SFB) | `C15:v=80` | Set's the wifi port, this is the port used to listen on, default value is 80 |


Common error responses you may see: `Missing param`, `Missing params`, `Missing name`, `Empty name`, `Index out of range`, `Slot out of range`, `Relay out of range (or 255 to clear)`, `EEPROM commit failed`, `Unknown config command`.


## Acknowledgement Commands
These commands are used in response to receiving a command.
